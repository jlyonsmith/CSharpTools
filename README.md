# Development Tools for C#

A collection of useful command line development tools for C# programmers written in [C#](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_&lpar;programming_language&rpar;) and targeting the [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) platform and [Xamarin Studio](http://xamarin.com/studio).

- __Strapper__ generates strongly type C# wrappers for string resources.
- __Ender__ reports on and fixing line endings
- __Vamper__ updates file and product version numbers across a variety of different file types
- __Doozer__ displays //TODO: comments in C# source files
- __Lindex__ generates a line index for text base log files
- __Projector__ clones a project and renames and re-guids the project files
- __Popper__ swaps a project back and forth between a NuGet and local project references

__Strapper__ is useful in conjunction with my [ToolBelt](https://github.com/jlyonsmith/ToolBelt) project for generating strongly typed string resource wrappers.
