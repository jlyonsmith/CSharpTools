# Simple Development Tools

A collection of useful tools command line development tools written in C# and Mono.

- __Buckle__ is for generating strongly type C# wrappers for string resources.
- __Hammer__ is for reporting on and fixing line endings
- __Chalk__ is for updating file and product version numbers across a variety of different file types
- __Chisel__ is for reporting on and fixing spaces/tab line beginnings in text files

An _almost_ equivalent [Python project](https://github.com/jlyonsmith/Tools) exists.  __Buckle__ is useful in conjunction with my [ToolBelt](https://github.com/jlyonsmith/ToolBelt) project.
