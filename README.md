# Simple Development Tools

A collection of useful tools command line development tools written in C# and Mono.

- __Strapper__ generates strongly type C# wrappers for string resources.
- __Ender__ reports on and fixing line endings
- __Vamper__ updates file and product version numbers across a variety of different file types
- __Doozer__ displays //TODO: comments in C# source files
- __Lindex__ generates a line index for text base log files
- __Projector__ clones a project and renames and re-guids the project files

__Strapper__ is useful in conjunction with my [ToolBelt](https://github.com/jlyonsmith/ToolBelt) project for generating strongly typed string resource wrappers.

A [Python project](https://github.com/jlyonsmith/Tools) exists with many of the same tools, with their old names.
